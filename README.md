# Spam Detection using LSTM (RNN)

## Overview  
This project implements a **Spam Detection System** using a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** layers.  
It classifies text messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** based on their content.  
The model is trained on labeled text data and deployed using **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface.

## üöÄ Usage
- The notebook handles data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.  
- The Streamlit app allows you to input text messages and see predictions in real-time:
  - **Spam** ‚Üí flagged as unwanted or malicious  
  - **Ham** ‚Üí legitimate/non-spam messages

---

## üìä Model Performance
- Achieved **high accuracy (~97%)** on validation data  
- Well-balanced precision and recall scores for both spam and ham classes  
- Visualized training and validation loss curves in notebook

---

## üîÆ Future Improvements
- Explore using **Attention mechanisms**, **GRU**, or **Transformer-based models** to achieve better results
- Integrate **pre-trained embeddings** (GloVe, FastText)
- Deploy as a **REST API** using Flask or FastAPI
- Enhance dataset diversity for multilingual spam detection
